==================

Hi stranger, thanks for your love!

If you're looking to improve `simpletoc`, be sure:

* To search for PR and issues, someone might had the same idea already.
* Read the [LICENSE](./LICENSE).
* Install nodejs v6 or above.
* Fork the repo.
* Clone your fork.
* Run `npm install` inside the repo.
* Document your changes.
* Run `npm run test` before committing your changes.
* Do NOT add the `dist/` folder to your commit, it is intended to be built only on releases, to prevent the repo from growing too much.
* Commit, push, and open a pull request.
* Ask for review.
* Be patient.

If you're looking to add a feature, please open an issue to discuss it first; `simpletoc` aims to be simple.

Love. â™¥
